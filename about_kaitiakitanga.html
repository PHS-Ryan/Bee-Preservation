        <p>
            Practicing Kaitiakitanga means caring for 
            bees by supporting their environment. 
            In Auckland, this can include planting flowers
             like manuka and harakeke, avoiding harmful
              pesticides and protecting bees nests by making 
              sure they are out of reach from predators.

                <h1>The threats</h1>
                <P>
                    One of the biggest threats to bees 
                    is the use of harmful pesticides, 
                    which can poison bees and disrupt 
                    their ability to navigate. Habitat loss due 
                    to city development and also reduces the amount of 
                    flowers and hives. Climate change is another major threat, 
                    as it affects the blooming times of plants and affects bee behavior.

        <h1>How to get involved</h1>
        <p>In New Zealand, there are many ways we can help 
            protect bees and support their survival. One of 
            the best things we can do is plant bee friendly 
            flowers like manuka, clover, and lavender in our 
            gardens or schools, which give bees food. Avoiding 
            harmful sprays and chemicals is also important, 
            especially during the day when bees are most active. 
            Supporting local honey and beekeepers helps keep small, 
            healthy bee colonies going. Joining community 
            gardens or local conservation groups that care for bees 
            and provide suitable spaces for bees to thrive is another way you can
            help bees thrive and help them help us.
