        <h1>Why are bees endangered</h1>
        <h2>The main problems</h2>
        <p>
            Bees are endangered because of habitat destruction, 
            pesticide use, climate change and disease. 
            These factors threaten 
            bee populations and disrupt their ability to reproduce and pollinate.

    <div class="infomation">
        <h1>Why are bees important?</h1>
        <P>
            Bees are important because they help pollinate plants,
             which means they move pollen from one flower to another
              so plants can grow fruits, vegetables, and seeds. 
              About one-third of the food we eat depends on pollination, 
              and bees are some of the best pollinators. Without bees, 
              we would have fewer crops like apples, berries, and almonds. 
              Bees also help flowers and trees grow, which gives animals food and shelter. 
              By helping plants grow, bees keep balanced.
        </P>

        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <li>A single bee can visit up to 5,000 flowers in one day.</li>
        <li>Bees pollinate about 70% of the crops we eat.</li>
        <li>Without bees, weâ€™d have far fewer fruits and vegetables.</li>

        <h1>Looking Further</h1>
        <h2>Reasons for depopulation</h2>
        <p>Bees are facing many dangers that are causing their numbers to drop around the world. 
        One of the biggest problems is the use of harmful pesticides, which can confuse bees 
        and make it hard for them to find their way back to the hive or even survive. Bees 
        are also losing their homes as more land is used for building or farming, and there 
        are fewer flowers for them to collect nectar from. Climate change is another issue 
        because it affects when plants bloom, so bees might not find food when they need it. 
        We can help protect bees by planting more flowers, using fewer chemicals in our gardens, 
        and learning more about how important bees are. Practicing kaitiakitanga, which means 
        caring for the environment, reminds us to look after bees and nature for the future.
