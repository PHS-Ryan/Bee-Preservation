        <h1>What is Kaitiakitanga?</h1>
        <P>Kaitiakitanga is a Māori concept from New <br>Zealand that means guardianship, 
            especially <br>of the environment. 
            It involves taking <br>responsibility to protect and care for the <br>natural world, 
            water, plants, and animals so <br>they can be sustained for future generations.
            <br>It’s about respect, balance, and maintaining <br>the health of ecosystems 
             through <br>management and connection to the environment.</P>
